                                          ** This is my College Final Year Project. **

MowBotic (Automated Lawn Mower)

• User-Friendly device to tidy up the garden. A mower that is portable, durable, and easy to operate and maintain.

• It also aims to design a self-powered mower with an electrical source; a cordless electric lawn mower.

• Ability to mow larger areas without waiting for a battery to charge.

Motivation:

There are about 70 million households in the US living in the suburban area. They need to mow their lawns biweekly, weekly or monthly. The average lawn mowing time is 1-2 hours or the cost is $20-$50 if you are hiring someone to do it for you. By automating this task, it allows individuals to better spend their time and allow the automated lawn mower to take over this mundane task

Inspiration:

The inspiration for this project came from wanting to innovate on the idea of a Roomba, by applying its technology to a different application. It is to create an autonomous lawn mower that meets the needs of modern standards. The design will focus on minimizing the time and money spent on lawn mowing
